                History of Spotify!
            </h2>
            <p>
                Spotify was founded in 2006 (launched in 2008) by Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon in Stockholm, Sweden. They wanted to create a platform that would rival the rampant music piracy issues that were stealing money from artists and the music industry as a whole. Their goal was to create a platform that would be so seamless and user friendly that it would stop people from pirating music through joining Spotify. The platform did not blow up right away, it hit the milestone of 1 million subscribers in 2011 (this coincides with enormous investments from Silicon Valley). In order to be competitive in the industry, Spotify needed to make deals with record labels in order to license their music and create royalty deals for artists. This started in Europe and did not hit America until July of 2011. As a growing company this was difficult, and they have been plagued by accusations that the number of streams an artistâ€™s song receives is not proportionate to the money that artist makes.

                As Spotify gained major traction within the music and tech industries, they rolled out many different ways to attract users to their platform. For example, college students who have an email address from their university receive a much-discounted monthly fee. This made the app much more accessible to the consumer base that would use it the most. They also implemented new features to their platform, for example, exclusive videos and rights to artists' music, interviews, playlists, etc. Today the platform has over 155 million paying subscribers, 345 million monthly active listeners, over 2 million podcasts, and over 70 million music tracks. It is easy to say that Spotify has taken over the music industry and changed the way music is created and consumed forever.
