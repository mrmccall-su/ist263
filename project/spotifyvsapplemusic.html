                        SoundGuys.com came to this conclusion: “After comparing these two streaming services, it’s safe to say that neither Apple Music nor Spotify Premium is better than the other. Whichever platform you choose depends on your own wants and needs."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "If you’re someone who avidly uses Apple devices in their daily life, you’ll appreciate Apple Music’s familiar UI design language, Siri support, and automatic synchronization across Apple devices."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "On the other hand, Spotify has always been designed with cross-compatibility in mind. If you’re looking to step out of Apple’s ecosystem when streaming music, Spotify is sure to satisfy listeners with its vast collection of music and podcasts, and its powerful music recommendation algorithms."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "However, while you can access Spotify for free, Premium doesn’t just get rid of the ads. The free version of Spotify doesn’t let you save music locally, which can tax mobile data plans, and also limits how often you can skip songs while using the mobile app (6 an hour). Still, it’s a great option if you want to save money and mainly listen to music on your computer.”

                            I have been a loyal Spotify user for over 5 years at this point and I don’t think I will ever switch to Apple Music. I could not rave enough about the music discovery features that Spotify touts. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Not only does their algorithm create playlists for you with music that you have listened to or liked, but uses that same music to suggest new music that is similar to what you’ve been listening to. I use these features virtually daily; more specifically I use the “Daily Drive” playlist which is populated with the songs that I listen to most and Spotify also adds in 15-minute clips of podcasts to introduce you to new content. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The extensive list of curated playlists that Spotify releases is amazing for finding new sounds and new artists to listen to for any mood. Spotify apps are also available on all Apple Devices including the Apple TV, Mac book, iPhone, and CarPlay. These apps work virtually seamlessly (there are a few bugs) and switching to Apple Music within the Apple environment is not worth the slight better interaction on Apple devices.

                    <p>
                        From customer reviews, critic reviews, and personal experience we can come to a similar conclusion to SoundGuys.com. There is no clear cut better streaming service and it ultimately comes down to what you are looking for as a consumer.

                    <p>
                        I believe Spotify is the better option for students and those who are trying to find new music to listen to. The new music features on Spotify are unbeatable and the ability to interact with friends by seeing what they are listening to in real time and joining their group sessions is perfect for the social settings college students find themselves in.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Apple Music seems to be more geared toward people who know what music they want to listen to and don’t need any help finding new music. It is also for those who are attached to the Apple technology ecosystem and want a seamless experience across all of their devices.
